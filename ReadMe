# Drone Firmware Extraction Experiment

Welcome to my GitHub! I ordered a set of drones from an online 
Chinese supplier that will remain unnamed a few days ago. Once they arrive, 
I'll be carefully uncovering the drones' electronic components, which I 
will attach to a logical analyzer and a ft232h board. Before I get ahead 
of myself, let's see if I can correctly disassemble the shell of the drone
to get to the firmware! I will be documenting the progress I make on 
this repo, which will include photos and videos of the process.

**Faces and Figures:** Front Beauty, but behind both are unique purposes.
